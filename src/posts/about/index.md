Currently working as a frontend engineer at Doctor.com, 
contributing to a complete rewrite of our
admin portal using React. It's been a whirlwind of learning
and being part such an enormous project. We're about to
release soon!

Outside of work, I spend A LOT of time with my brat of a dog,
Pim. Goals with her include being featured on @dogsthathike
and being an all-around good citizen.
