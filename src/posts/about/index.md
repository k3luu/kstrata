Currently working as a frontend engineer at Doctor.com, 
contributing to a complete rewrite of our
admin portal using React. It's been a whirlwind of learning
and being part of such an enormous project. We're about to
release soon!

Outside of work, I spend A LOT of time with my brat of a dog,
Pim. Goals with her include being featured on @dogsthathike
and being an all-around good citizen.

When I do finally get some time to myself, I really enjoy
reading. I love fantasy fiction! I'll happily take any recommendations.
I take a lot of pleasure in dabbling in art, whether it's
photography, drawing, or trying out my watercoloring skills.
